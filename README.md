# The Rise NYC

This is a companion app for [The Rise NYC](http://www.therisenyc.com), a free outdoor fitness group in New York City.

**This version is for Android phones.**

## What's the deal with The Rise?

The Rise NYC currently meets in public locations in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens, at 6:30 AM on weekdays. Though all the workouts happen at the same time, and all fall under the Rise umbrella, they are quite different in nature.

For example:

* Mondayâ€™s workout is a tabata style high intensity interval training (HIIT) workout, which calls for 20 seconds of exercise followed by 10 seconds of rest. This requires a timer and whistle to keep track of time and indicate the start of each section, respectively.
* On Wednesday, the workout generally contains a deck of cards segment, which assigns an exercise to a suit, and the number of repetitions to the number on the card (face cards are also assigned numerical values).
* On Thursday, there is a workout in Queens that has a section called Dice. This relies on the roll of a six sided die to select an exercise, which the group does ten of together.

## Why do you need an app for this?

It is the responsibility of each team member to either bring the necessary props for their workout, or to download an app. While there are indeed apps for all of the above activities, this creates a lack of uniformity between days of the week. Furthermore, if the person who normally brings the app is absent, then someone else must decide on an app to download in order to fulfill the task.

Thus, the concept of The Rise NYC app was born! **It's a single app that contains all the tools needed to run any of the Rise workouts happening throughout the week.**

## What's included? 
The following features are included in version 1.0:

* A list of locations, sorted both by days of the week and by borough
* Timer, deck of cards, and dice modules within the app. All will have presets available
* A list of built in exercises

## Will there be additional features in future versions?

Maybe. I'm currently working on getting the iOS version up to speed and will make that repository public once it's done. That's top priority right now. The following features would be the goal of the next version:

* The ability to push completed activities to various social media platforms
* Demonstration videos tied to the various exercises built into the app
* A route planner that recommends when to leave home to arrive at each workout in time
