When we start the timer it is on! Short intervals of high intensity bodyweight exercises like burpees, pushups, situps, dips, and box jumps. This 30 minute HIIT workout will kick your butt and help you discover the balance between speed and strength.

We pace ourselves through a Tabata-style interval workout. What is that? Timed intervals of exercises at maximum effort with short breaks to catch your breath. Add some variety to your routine and join us in a fun, group setting. This workout will challenge everybody. It doesn't matter if you're old, young, new, experienced, athletic, tattooed, ripped, stocky, hippie, clean cut, square, or hipster. Everybody is welcome.

We meet at the fountain in Washington Square Park. Run or bike your way there as a warmup. You will love pushing yourself with this high energy, no frills workout. And did we mention smiles and high fives? The smiles are big and shiny and the supply of high fives is endless! In 30 minutes you will laugh, sweat, and smile harder than ever before.

So to recap: High intensity interval training. Washington Square Park. Mondays @ 6:30 AM. See you there!
