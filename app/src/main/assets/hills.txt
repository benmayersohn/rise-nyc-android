Every Friday morning is a challenge on the Williamsburg Bridge. Some weeks we bust our butts to run up and down the Manhattan-side incline for thirty minutes. Other weeks we do short, timed sprint intervals. Sometimes we set up workout stations and run from exercise to exercise. The results are unmistakable.
