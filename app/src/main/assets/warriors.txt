Tuesday is a big day for the outer boroughs. The Brooklyn Body Circuit is a popular workout, but it's always a tough trek for the Queens crew (we've emailed the MTA about the possibility of building an express line from Forest Hills to Grand Army Plaza, but it appears that isn't their top priority right now).

For these far travelers, The Rise has a second option: the Queens Warriors! Ever been to a Kings of Queens workout? Well, this one's in the same place: MacDonald Park in Forest Hills (see the map at the bottom of this page).

"Two Queens Rise workouts in one week??", they asked incredulously.  Well, Manhattan has four, so why let the shorter island have all the glory?

If you're looking for a workout that lacks fun, excitement, and buttkicking potential, then this is not the workout for you. We'll tackle all the bodyweight exercises we know and love, and some exercises that are rarely seen at other Rise workouts. Have no idea what "slalom hops" are? You'll just have to show up on Tuesday to find out!

And you won't want to miss out on the classic coffee and conversation combo afterwards!

Tuesdays are Risier than ever, folks. Come be a part of it!
